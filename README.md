Introduction
------------

**CompliancePulse** is a robust and sophisticated Clarity smart contract designed for automated compliance monitoring and reporting on the Stacks blockchain. This contract serves as a decentralized compliance engine, leveraging data from off-chain oracles to track the regulatory status of various entities. It automates key compliance workflows, including data ingestion, validation, risk assessment, and report generation, all while maintaining a secure and transparent audit trail. The system is built to provide real-time insights into compliance health, proactively identify potential violations, and facilitate timely escalations.

This project goes beyond basic compliance tracking by incorporating an advanced **Compliance Intelligence and Predictive Risk Assessment System**. This cutting-edge feature utilizes historical data and on-chain metrics to generate comprehensive reports, forecast compliance risks, and recommend automated interventions, such as scheduling priority audits for high-risk entities.

Features
--------

-   **Decentralized Compliance Engine:** Manages compliance data from authorized external oracles.

-   **Role-Based Access Control:** Securely restricts critical functions (e.g., adding oracles, pausing the contract) to the `CONTRACT-OWNER`.

-   **Automated Compliance Status:** Automatically updates an entity's compliance status (`COMPLIANT`, `NON-COMPLIANT`, `CRITICAL`) based on submitted oracle data.

-   **Predictive Risk Assessment:** An advanced private function `calculate-predictive-risk-score` analyzes an entity's data to forecast future risk and potential violations.

-   **Comprehensive Reporting:** The `generate-compliance-intelligence-report` function provides a detailed, AI-driven report on overall compliance health, risk distribution, and predictive insights for a list of entities.

-   **Audit Trails:** The `audit-trails` map logs all audits, including findings and recommendations, ensuring a comprehensive historical record.

-   **Automated Escalation:** Automatically queues escalations for critical compliance failures, triggering a predefined response workflow.

-   **Oracle Reputation System:** Tracks and updates oracle reputation based on the accuracy and validation of their submitted reports, promoting a network of reliable data providers.

-   **Contract Lifecycle Management:** Includes public functions to `pause-contract` and `unpause-contract` for maintenance or emergency situations.

-   **Efficient Data Handling:** Uses Clarity's maps and lists to efficiently store and retrieve compliance data, reports, and audit logs.

Data Structures
---------------

The contract relies on several key maps and data variables to store and manage its state.

-   `authorized-oracles`: A map that tracks authorized principals, storing their activity status, reputation score, and report history.

-   `compliance-entities`: A map detailing each tracked entity, including their compliance score, status, violation count, and risk category.

-   `compliance-reports`: A map that stores individual compliance reports submitted by oracles, including data hashes, metrics, and validation status.

-   `audit-trails`: A map for logging detailed audit findings and recommendations.

-   `escalation-queue`: A map to manage and track critical compliance violation escalations.

-   `next-report-id`, `next-audit-id`, `next-escalation-id`: Data variables to ensure unique identifiers for reports, audits, and escalations.

-   `total-entities`, `oracle-count`, `contract-paused`: Global variables for contract statistics and state.

Constants & Error Codes
-----------------------

### Constants

-   `CONTRACT-OWNER`: The principal address with full administrative privileges.

-   `MIN-COMPLIANCE-SCORE`: The minimum score (70) required for an entity to be considered `COMPLIANT`.

-   `CRITICAL-COMPLIANCE-THRESHOLD`: The score threshold (40) below which an entity is flagged as `CRITICAL`.

-   `MAX-ORACLES`: The maximum number of oracles (10) that can be authorized.

-   `ESCALATION-DELAY`: The delay (144 blocks, ~24 hours) before an escalation can be resolved.

-   `AUDIT-RETENTION-PERIOD`: The period (4320 blocks, ~30 days) for which audit logs are retained.

### Error Codes

-   `ERR-UNAUTHORIZED`: The sender is not authorized to perform the action.

-   `ERR-INVALID-ORACLE`: An invalid or non-existent oracle was specified.

-   `ERR-INVALID-DATA`: The submitted data is invalid (e.g., empty metrics list).

-   `ERR-ENTITY-NOT-FOUND`: The specified entity does not exist in the `compliance-entities` map.

-   `ERR-ALREADY-EXISTS`: The oracle or entity already exists.

-   `ERR-INSUFFICIENT-BALANCE`: The transaction sender has an insufficient balance.

-   `ERR-INVALID-TIMEFRAME`: The specified timeframe for analysis is outside the allowed range.

-   `ERR-ESCALATION-PENDING`: An escalation for the entity is already pending.

Public Functions
----------------

-   `pause-contract()`: Temporarily halts the contract, restricting all non-owner functions. Callable only by the `CONTRACT-OWNER`.

-   `unpause-contract()`: Resumes normal contract operations. Callable only by the `CONTRACT-OWNER`.

-   `add-oracle(principal, uint)`: Authorizes a new oracle with an initial reputation score. Callable only by the `CONTRACT-OWNER`.

-   `deactivate-oracle(principal)`: Deactivates an existing oracle. Callable only by the `CONTRACT-OWNER`.

-   `register-entity(principal, (string-ascii 50))`: Registers a new entity for compliance tracking. Callable only by the `CONTRACT-OWNER`.

-   `submit-compliance-data(principal, (buff 32), (list 5 uint), (string-ascii 200), (string-ascii 10))`: Allows an authorized oracle to submit a compliance report for an entity.

-   `validate-report(principal, uint, bool)`: Allows the owner to validate or invalidate a submitted report, which in turn updates the submitting oracle's reputation.

-   `conduct-entity-audit(principal, (string-ascii 20), (list 10 uint), (string-ascii 300))`: Records an off-chain audit's findings and recommendations for an entity.

-   `generate-compliance-intelligence-report((list 50 principal), uint, uint, bool, (string-ascii 30))`: An advanced function that compiles an extensive report based on historical data, risk predictions, and regulatory trends. Callable by authorized oracles.

Private Functions
-----------------

-   `is-authorized-oracle(principal)`: A helper function to check if a given principal is an active oracle.

Deployment & Usage
------------------

To deploy and interact with this contract, you will need the Stacks CLI or a compatible wallet environment.

1.  **Deployment:** Deploy the contract to the Stacks blockchain, specifying the `CONTRACT-OWNER` at deployment.

2.  **Authorization:** The `CONTRACT-OWNER` must first use the `add-oracle` function to authorize trusted data providers.

3.  **Entity Registration:** Entities must be registered using `register-entity` before any compliance data can be submitted.

4.  **Data Submission:** Authorized oracles can submit compliance data via `submit-compliance-data`.

5.  **Reporting:** The `generate-compliance-intelligence-report` function can be called by an authorized oracle to get a comprehensive report.

Security Considerations
-----------------------

-   **Access Control:** All critical functions are protected by `asserts! (is-eq tx-sender CONTRACT-OWNER)`. It is crucial to manage the `CONTRACT-OWNER`'s key with extreme care.

-   **Data Integrity:** The use of `data-hash` in reports allows for off-chain verification of the submitted data, preventing tampering.

-   **Input Validation:** The contract uses `asserts!` to validate inputs, such as checking for empty lists, valid timeframes, and existence of entities, to prevent unexpected behavior.

-   **Overflow/Underflow:** All arithmetic operations are on `uint` and are carefully designed to avoid overflow issues where possible, with the Clarity VM handling the checks.

-   **Reentrancy:** The contract design is not susceptible to reentrancy attacks as it does not interact with external contracts in a way that could lead to such a vulnerability.
